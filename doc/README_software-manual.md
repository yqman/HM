Software manual instructions
============================
The software manual is written in plain text using LaTeX markup.

Prerequisites
-------------
The following tools are required to render the document:

- LaTeX (depending on the target platform)

Building
--------
A makefile is provided that will render a pdf from the LaTeX source. If LaTeX is installed, typing `make` ought to be sufficient.

Please do not commit updated PDFs to the git repository. This will be performed by the Software AHG prior to making an HM release.
